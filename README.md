# Overview

Thank you for taking the time to take our test. Your will be using this starter app, along with our API, to create a full stack application that will allow users to read, update, create and delete pets.

In case you are interested, our API uses the popular Pet Store data set as its source for data.

- This exercise is intended to be an example of a real world problem. Please use any and all resources at your disposal including, but not limited to, the internet, friends/colleagues, etc.

- You will be expected to demonstrate coding skills in alignment with industry best practices. Please focus on what you would consider "the right way" to write / design an application.

- Do not hesitate to ask questions. We are available via devtest@eimprovement.com

- Upon completion, you will be expected to present your application, via a pull request, to the eImprovement team. Be prepared to explain the thought process behind your code. Additionally, we would be interested in understanding any improvements that you might suggest.

- There are no tricks or "gotchas" in this code sample. If you are having problems connecting or see anything else strange, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

# The Test

We need you to build an application

1. Use the "Find Pets by status" endpoint to display a list of pets to the user: https://dev-test.azure-api.net/petstore/pet/findByStatus?status={status}
2. Use the "Update an existing pet" endpoint to allow users to flag pets as being sold in the component you built in step 1.
3. Use the "Add a new pet to the store" endpoint to allow users to create new pets.
4. Use the "Deletes a pet" endpoint to allows users to delete pets
